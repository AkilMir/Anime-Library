# Anime-Library
Created by Akil Mir and Shaun Joseph


This is a React-based wesbite that allows the user to search up anime and have a variety of different anime titles displayed. Additionally, the user can hover over the title cards to see the year the anime was released as well as the genre. The card also shows what the media type the anime is in.

The project uses the Jikan API to obtain results from the search input and provides a repsonse back to the client with all the results from the search, like images, alternate names, a synopsis, etc. We utilized various objects like the title and year from the JSON response to incorporate into our project.

One problem we faced while working on the project was which API to use in our project. We intitially were going to use the MyAnimeList API to provide search results to the user. However, we ran into authentication problems that hindered our ability to work on the project. Therefore, we decided to use the Jikan API because it gave the exact same results as the MyAnimeList API besides updating user info, and the Jikan API had no authentication.
